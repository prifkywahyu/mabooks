# Mobile programming project

My mobile programming final assignment, very first experience for knowing how to code Android. Pretty much exciting doing this test. The app I built is covered some features, there are:
1. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. SharedPreferences
3. Geolocation (not done yet, hahaha)
